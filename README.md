Nettools
========

Nettools is my collection of network automation tools.  Mostly
against Juniper JunOS devices. If a tool becomes large enough
to require its own repo I'll do so.

Features
--------

- Network automation.
- JunOS NETCONF.

Installation
------------

- Clone the repo, see details for each individual tool. Most are
to be run from the CLI.

Contribute
----------

- Issue Tracker: github.com/krisamundson/Nettools/issues
- Source Code: github.com/krisamundson/Nettools

Support
-------

I am not providing support for these tools and are to be used at your
own risk. I can be reached at kris@puppetlabs.com.

I will review PRs if you wish to contribute.
