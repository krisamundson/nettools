Nettools
========

Nettools is my collection of network automation tools.  Mostly
against Juniper JunOS devices. If a tool becomes large enough
to require its own repo I'll do so.

Features
--------

- Icinga compatible
- Use interface descriptions as your flag of what to care about

Installation
------------

- Clone the repo, see details for each individual tool. Most are
to be run from the CLI.
